I need a web game that implements a car game. The game should be a simple 2D car game where the player controls a car and the goal is to reach the end of the level. 
The game should be responsive and work on all devices. The game should have a score system. 
The game should have a single player mode. The game should have a logo. The game should have a favicon. 

The car moves along a road. The road has different obstacles to overcome. Every obstacle counts towards the score.
The player should be able to move car left and right. The player can accelerate and decelerate the car using arrow keys.



Next improvements:
- The game should have a background music. The game should have a sound effects.
